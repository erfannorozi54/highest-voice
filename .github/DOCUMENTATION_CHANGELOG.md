# Documentation Restructure - Changelog

## Summary

Cleaned up and consolidated all markdown documentation into organized structure.

## Changes Made

### ✅ Created `docs/` Directory

All documentation now lives in `/docs`:

- **docs/README.md** - Documentation index
- **docs/DEPLOYMENT.md** - Complete deployment guide for all networks
- **docs/AUTOMATION.md** - Chainlink Automation setup guide

### ❌ Removed Redundant Files

The following files were removed from root (content consolidated):

- `AUTOMATION_SUMMARY.md` → Merged into `docs/AUTOMATION.md`
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` → Became `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`
- `DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md` → Content merged into `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`
- `DEPLOY_QUICK_REF.md` → Content merged into `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`
- `INSTALL.md` → Content merged into `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`
- `KEEPER_QUICKSTART.md` → Merged into `docs/AUTOMATION.md`
- `KEEPER_SETUP.md` → Became `docs/AUTOMATION.md`
- `NETWORK_SETUP.md` → Content merged into `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`
- `SIMPLIFIED_WITHDRAWAL.md` → Outdated, removed
- `USER_FRIENDLY_IMPROVEMENTS.md` → Outdated, removed
- `WITHDRAWAL_GUIDE.md` → Outdated (functions changed), removed

### ✅ Updated Root README

**README.md** now:

- Clean, concise overview
- Links to docs for details
- Quick start commands
- Table of supported networks
- Key functions reference

## New Structure

```tree
highest-voice/
├── README.md                    # Main project overview
├── docs/
│   ├── README.md               # Documentation index
│   ├── DEPLOYMENT.md           # Deployment guide
│   └── AUTOMATION.md           # Automation guide
├── contracts/
├── deploy/
├── scripts/
├── test/
└── ui/
    └── README.md               # UI-specific docs
```

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Root** - Only README.md in root directory
2. **No Duplication** - Single source of truth for each topic
3. **Better Organization** - All docs in `/docs` directory
4. **Easier Maintenance** - Less files to keep updated
5. **Clear Structure** - Logical documentation hierarchy

## Migration Notes

### Old Links → New Links

| Old File | New Location |
|----------|--------------|
| `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` | `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` |
| `KEEPER_SETUP.md` | `docs/AUTOMATION.md` |
| `AUTOMATION_SUMMARY.md` | `docs/AUTOMATION.md` |
| All other guides | Consolidated into above |

### For Contributors

- Add new documentation to `/docs` directory
- Update `docs/README.md` index when adding new guides
- Keep root `README.md` concise with links to docs

## Content Verification

All essential content preserved:

- ✅ Deployment instructions (local, Sepolia, mainnet)
- ✅ Chainlink Automation setup
- ✅ Environment configuration
- ✅ Cost estimates
- ✅ Troubleshooting guides
- ✅ Network details
- ✅ Contract function reference

## Removed Content

Outdated information removed:

- ❌ Old withdrawal function documentation (functions changed)
- ❌ Duplicate deployment instructions
- ❌ Multiple "quick start" guides with same info

## Recommended Reading Order

1. Root `README.md` - Project overview
2. `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deploy your contracts
3. `docs/AUTOMATION.md` - Setup automation
4. Contract source code - Deep dive
