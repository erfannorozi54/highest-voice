## 🎯 Smart Contract Alignment

All UI components perfectly align with smart contract functions:

| Feature | Contract Function | UI Component | Status |
|---------|------------------|--------------|--------|
| NFT Certificates | `winnerNFTs(tokenId)` | NFTDisplay | ✅ |
| Tipping | `tipWinner(auctionId)` | TipButton | ✅ |
| User Stats | `getUserStats(address)` | UserProfile | ✅ |
| Leaderboard | `getLeaderboard()` | Leaderboard | ✅ |
| Treasury | `accumulatedSurplus()` | StatsOverview | ✅ |
| NFT Balance | `balanceOf(owner)` | UserProfile | ✅ |
| Total NFTs | `nextTokenId()` | StatsOverview | ✅ |
| Auction Tips | `getAuctionTips(id)` | TipButton | ✅ |

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Test locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev:local
   ```

2. **Deploy to testnet:**
   - Deploy contracts to Sepolia
   - Update contract addresses in `ui/src/contracts/config.ts`
   - Test all features

3. **Production deployment:**
   - Deploy to mainnet
   - Update mainnet contract addresses
   - Verify all features work
   - Enable OpenSea integration

## 🐛 Known Issues / Notes

1. TypeScript type inference is clean and safe
2. All components handle loading and error states
3. Contract address checks prevent errors on unsupported chains
4. Empty states provide helpful user guidance
